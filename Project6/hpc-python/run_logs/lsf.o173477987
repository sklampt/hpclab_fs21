The output (if any) follows:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
WARNING: No preset parameters were found for the device that Open MPI
detected:

  Local host:            eu-a2p-201
  Device name:           mlx5_2
  Device vendor ID:      0x02c9
  Device vendor part ID: 4119

Default device parameters will be used, which may result in lower
performance.  You can edit any of the files specified by the
btl_openib_device_param_files MCA parameter to set values for your
device.

NOTE: You can turn off this warning by setting the MCA parameter
      btl_openib_warn_no_device_params_found to 0.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
WARNING: There are more than one active ports on host 'eu-a2p-201', but the
default subnet GID prefix was detected on more than one of these
ports.  If these ports are connected to different physical IB
networks, this configuration will fail in Open MPI.  This version of
Open MPI requires that every physically separate IB subnet that is
used between connected MPI processes must have different subnet ID
values.

Please see this FAQ entry for more details:

  http://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=openfabrics#ofa-default-subnet-gid

NOTE: You can turn off this warning by setting the MCA parameter
      btl_openib_warn_default_gid_prefix to 0.
