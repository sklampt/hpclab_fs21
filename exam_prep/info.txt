*** EXAM TOPICS ***
    - short summary of all projects

    - which project most interesting (focus on that project)

    - project 1:
        - summary
        - performance plots of matrix-matrix addition, multiplication
        - max. performance Euler (exact numbers!)
        - explain dynamic/static scheduling of openMP
        - write code how to transpose matrix (with openMP)

    - project 2:
        -
        -
    
    - project 3:
        - Fisher equation
            - how to discretize (roughly)
            - performance plot
        -
    
    - project 4:
        - page rank:
            - how to make it more efficient when connectivity matrix G is known
                (maybe)
                - expected to mention methods of graph partitioning
        -

    - project 5:
        - explain methods, use, write down Laplace matrix for different graphs
        - show spectral bisection in graphs
        - draw graph where spectral bisection better than inertial bisection
        - complexity of spectral and inertial graphclustering
            - spectral bisection:
                - sparse eigensolver
                - probably O(n²):
                    - first calculate matrix L: O(n²)
                    - search eigenvectors: O(n³), but only need 1 eigenvector: O(n²)
                    - calculate median: O(n)
                    => should be O(n²)
        - spectral bisection in detail
        - how does performance graph of mini-PDE with MPI look
        - pro/contra: spectral & inertial bisection
        - how to improve load balancing

    - project 6:
        -

    - project 7:
